                        I am thoroughly enjoying the course! I have decided to take the 
                        Computer science route which includes study in Java, Python, 
                        algorithms, statistics, and advanced mathematics. 
                        So far, I've completed 150 out of 360 credits and I hope to 
                        graduate with First Class Hons.
