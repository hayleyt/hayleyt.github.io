            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
               I'm a computing and statistics student studying part-time with the Open University. 
               I'm looking to move into a new career in software development. I'm mostly 
               self taught with a strong interest in design and front-end technologies, 
               particularly Javascript, React and Vue. I have experience in designing, 
               building and hosting Wordpress websites and eccommerce sites for small 
               businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm keen to secure an entry level position in a technology company with 
               opportunities for progression.
            </p>
